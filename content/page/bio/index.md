I'm Brian Guthrie, a software engineer, leader and entrepreneur based in New York City. I write about the intersection of software, talent, complexity, and systems thinking. Presently I lead a team at [Justworks](https://justworks.com) that helps ambitious firms grow globally. Prior to this, I founded [Orgspace](https://orgspace.io), led engineering at [Meetup](https://meetup.com), and hacked all over the world with [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com), including, for a time, with [Aaron Swartz](https://www.rememberaaronsw.com/).

I'm a software generalist: I have strong preferences about tech and process but my job is primarily to _ship things that matter to people_. I've held roles from CTO to tech support, and I've shipped at every layer of the stack. I care about craft, but I care more about outcomes, and about building ways of working that serve both the people doing the work and the people relying on it.

Some of it has worked and some hasn’t. I'm happy to share stories.
