I've worked in the software industry for over 20 years. I have been a consultant, a line engineer, a director, a founder, and a CTO. I have worked at firms as small as 2 other engineers and as large as 50,000. I frequently get asked how to move faster in software. This is what I tell them.

## Rules for moving faster

I am not some kind of software process relativist. Some teams ship software more quickly and at higher quality than others, and I think that all else being equal, good teams think a lot about how to move quickly.

Here are my common-sense rules for moving fast:

1. It Is Possible To Move Fast, And Fast Matters
2. Fast Is Measured By What Other People See
3. It Is Possible To Be Both Fast And Good
4. It Is Everyone's Responsibility To Move Fast
5. Fast Is More Important Than Efficiency Or Utilization
6. Fast Does Not End When You Ship
7. To Move Fast, Be Prepared To Change

### It Is Possible To Move Fast, And Fast Matters

Some people argue that it is silly to optimize for moving fast, since not all features move the needle, and instead you should focus a lot on getting each individual feature right. I disagree. The mental model I use for most features is that each one represents a _bet_ on a some future payoff. They will not all pay off, nor will the ones that do pay off to the same degree. Conversely, polished, well-considered implementations are often bested by ones that are better-timed or more idiosyncratic. All else being equal, shipping more frequently means more turns at-bat.

The world is full of examples of things that moved quickly when everyone involved decided that they had to. The [Berlin Airlift](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/berlin-airlift). The [construction of the Empire State Building](https://chrisgagne.com/1255/mary-poppendiecks-the-tyranny-of-the-plan/). Stripe's Patrick Collison has a [whole page of this stuff](https://patrickcollison.com/fast).

The hardest part of moving fast is deciding that it is necessary, and then convincing everyone that it is possible.

### Fast Is Measured By What Other People See

#### Lead Time

Lead time—the wall-clock time between when a feature is requested and when it is delivered in a way that adds value—is the right way to think about moving faster. The right measure is _not_ efficiency or typing speed or utilization or velocity or burn. It is the time between an _outside observer_ believes you have begun working on something and when it is functionally complete.

Lead time is a model. Like all models, it is wrong but sometimes useful. It is not hard to identify its holes; in no particular order: (1) your team may not have an outside observer who cares; (2) "value" has an amorphous definition that is hard to measure; (3) "functionally complete" has an amorphous definition is that is hard to measure; (4) many other things also turn out to matter; and last but not least, (5) even if you ship software fast, the business can still fail. Fast is not the same thing as successful.

#### Eyeballs

### It Is Possible To Be Both Fast And Good

#### The Journey Can Be Good

#### The Destination Can Be Good

Shipping software fast is not the same thing as shipping software at (1) a high degree of functional quality or (2) with a particularly strong match to user desire or business goals. Nonetheless, I see many teams making the mistake of insisting that you must move slowly and deliberately in order to move quickly. This is false, or at best misleading.

### It Is Everyone's Responsibility To Move Fast

Individual engineers and teams have enormous agency here. Craft matters.

Directors and CTOs have enormous responsibility here. Systems matter.

### Fast Is More Important Than Efficiency Or Utilization

### Fast Does Not End When You Ship

### To Move Fast, Be Prepared To Change

## How

Build clarity
Start from value and work backwards
Ship early and control scope
Establish a cadence
Measure what's slow and improve it
Reward the right behaviors
Hire the right people
