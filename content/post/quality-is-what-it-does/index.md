I want to love software because I want to love what I make. I love what people experience. I love the way I feel when I use a thing I really like, and the way I'm sure they want to use their things too. They want to love them.

I don't care about the distinction between backend and frontend and mobile because at root I care about what people experience, and secondarily about how frequently they get to experience novel versions of it. If you offer me a mobile app, and for whatever reason I need to use a mobile app, I want it to be great. I want it to feel great no matter how I'm interacting with your service. I, to a first approximation, do not want to give a crap about the format. I base-expect it to be good enough.

This is what quality means, eventually: it means that the job you need the software to do as a user is done well. There is no independently sufficient adequate proxy for user perception of that succcess. Beautiful code sometimes produces poor results.The thing has to work at a minimum, and anything short of that is gravy.
