In the winter of 2022-23 I was running a startup, Orgspace, when OpenAI released ChatGPT 2.5 and properly kicked off a new technical goldrush focused on the use and development of LLMs. About six months prior, the first truly interesting AI tools, ones for generating images, had hit the market and it was already being clear that the next generation of AI tools was going to be a big deal. ChatGPT 3 cemented that.

I remember it as well because my startup was not doing very well—we were struggling to gain traction or make sales—and so when it came out there was a moment when my cofounder and I stared at each other and asked ourselves, in a crisis of confidence: why on earth are we working on this?

The VC market had dried up suddenly the year prior, and we were not on track for a subsequent raise unless something drastic changed. It seemed like the rational thing to do, if you were in the business of placing bets on the future, was to place every last dollar you had in betting on AI.

So some months later my cofounder quit and joined NVIDIA.

It would have been easy to be angry, or frustrated, with those tools. They were at least in part responsible for us losing our nerve and walking away from the opportunity we were pursuing. Some of them seemed ethically problematic, most especially the image generation tools. And with two small children at home, I found myself contemplating what the future would look like when any child had an always-on teaching assistant that understood virtually all human knowledge and could modulate it on demand to any level of reading comprehension. I wondered what would happen when someone chose to stick a code generation tool with opinions inside a `for` loop. It was and is a sobering thought.

But I didn't get angry, for two reasons:

1. The act of putting on the mantle of a founder again, and accepting the help of institutional investors, had asked of me to put aside my cynicism and approach technology with a little more hope and optimism.
2. These tools were and are self-evidently awesome. They are not perfect, and they come with very notable caveats, but they are _phenomenal_. My wife is a corporate lawyer, and the other day she asked an LLM to list all of the regulatory requirements of a publicly-traded company and oh yes, please phrase them in Pirate Speak, and it did it _flawlessly_.

I am not making an argument that this is _good_ in some kind of broader societal sense. I just _refuse_ to accept the narrative that these tools are _shitty_. They are self-evidently, staggeringly capable. Do we forget so quickly what is possible when a truly new tech emerges? As the [Recode podcast]() once pointed out, "An LLM is over here passing the bar exam and we're pretending to not be impressed."

### The 2024 election

Since then, I've noticed a number of my friends divide in their attitudes to LLMs across somewhat ideological lines. My friends who are generally on the left (most of them) mistrust LLMs, find them to be unforgivably encumbered by ethical concerns, and, oh yes, think they're shitty _anyway_.

My friends on the right, or at any rate those who admit to it, fall into the opposite camp: they _fucking love them_, and think they're _great_, and cannot _wait_ to upload their brains into Elon Musk's space robots, or whatever. At least one of them is an explicit accelerationist, and no, pointing out that neither Snow Crash nor Accelerando were intended to be read as _models to be emulated_ seems to do any good.

A similar narrative plays out with Elon Musk: self-landing rockets are _awesome_, and doesn't he have a point with X? No, he doesn't: he's shitty, and he's just a serial grifter; he didn't even found Tesla.

As I write this, we are one month past the re-election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States, and the left is coming to terms with the idea that some of the narratives we cherish are out of step with the broader culture. I think this is a tough one: we (and I include myself and many of my fellow engineers in this we) have become so disgusted _ourselves_ with the Silicon Valley-ification of everything, we have held our noses so reliably and consistently with Facebook and Tiktok and Tesla and Brex and e-scooters for so long, that we have lost sight of the idea that a lot of people basically like this stuff. They may not like Silicon Valley or California more generally _per se_, but they are proud to live in a country that still in some sense is helping to create the future. It is _prima facie_[^1] evidence that we are still, occasionally, capable of doing cool stuff as a nation, a bright spot amongst the crumbling bridges and chipping paint on our public infrastructure, and that inventing and popularizing cool new stuff has always involved some amount of discomfort for the people who prefer the shitty old stuff.

It is this, more than anything else, that explains, I think, the swing of many (although not even most, I think) of the VC class to the right: it is self-evident that they are supplying the tools to create what bright spots exist in our innovation economy, it is still _incredibly_ easy to raise funds and take risks in the United States compared to the rest of the world, and they wish that the broader intelligentsia would stop yelling at them about it.

I am an American citizen, but I was not born here and did not grow up here and have spent much time as an adult living elsewhere. Consequently, I try to be globally-minded in my view of this country, and to have some perspective about it. We have a poor healthcare system that the right has consistently undermined. Our loss of state capability has been devastating, as Jennifer Pahlka notes in her phenomenal [Recoding America](https://www.recodingamerica.us/). We cannot build or maintain major infrastructure anymore. Our gun laws are barbaric.[^2] Part of Trump's appeal is that people can see the evidence of this decay all around them, and the conscientious preservation of the status quo is driving them out of their gourd. It is _visceral_.

But one thing we still somehow do extraordinarily well is private-sector technical innovation. And when the major organs of American news reporting started leveling their guns against former startups like Google and Facebook, major players whose dominance had made them arrogant and complacent, they could not resist the temptation when looking for culprits to point their finger at startup culture more generally. (I was reminded again the other day of the [NYT's shocking treatment of Slate Star Codex]().) And that _stings_, even (and perhaps especially) to people who otherwise see themselves as defenders of institutions like the free press.

So for my part, while I did not vote for Donald Trump and fear for the future of those of our institutions which deserve our concern, for my part, I am trying to embrace some measure of technical optimism, because it is merited and because I remain convinced that technical innovation's natural home is with the left side of the United States political spectrum. _And I refuse to be skeptical of AI's capabilities_.

[^1]: Leftists would probably lose fewer elections if we stopped using phrases like _prima facie_.
[^2]: I have two small children that I love with all my heart. I will simply never, ever forgive or understand our cheerful willingness to allow many of them to be shot periodically, in their cheerful faces and round guts and tiny limbs, in their schools and playgrounds, again and again, to preserve the right to possess certain kinds of especially lethal arms, under the theory that curtailing them would threaten our freedoms in some amorphous away, even though the concrete evidence for this is weak at best. On this point I decline any compromise or moderation; if you disagree then fuck you.
