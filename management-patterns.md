management patterns:

- cascade the process (eg take an MBR and run it internally)
- hack the system
- build to split
- tighten the cadence
- alter the synchrony (turning meetings into emails, and vice versa)
- structured inputs, structured outputs
- the pre-read
- team autarky
- team interface boundary
- fungible resources
- talent is everything (talent is nothing)
- objectives and key results
